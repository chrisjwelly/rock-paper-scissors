# Rock, Paper, Scissors
A project [task](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors?ref=lnav#assignment) in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).

A console-only game that simulates the well-known "rock, paper, scissors".

## How to play
1. Open `index.html` locally in a browser. It will be an empty page; don't be alarmed. 
2. Open the developer tools (can be done by right clicking and selecting 'inspect') and open the console.
3. Type `game()` and press enter.
4. There will be 5 rounds: at each round, you are to enter "rock", "paper", or "scissors" as prompted (without the quotes).
5. Good luck!

Note: While the input "rock", "paper", and "scissors" can take in the form of any letter cases (i.e. "RoCk", "SCISSORS" will work), any other inputs (e.g. "rocks", "John Cena") will automatically make you lose the round. Currently, there is no input validation for any input aside from these 3.
